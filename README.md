# AI-Agent-for-Axelrod-Tournaments
This repository contains my project for the course of "Computational Intelligence and Deep Reinforcement Learning" of the Computer Science department in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

## Description
In this project we develop and test an agent that participates in Axelrod Tournaments (aka Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma). We test different architectures for the neural network of the model and we present the results after we place the agent in different type of tournaments.
